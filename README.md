This is a small breakout game that I made to test a new approach of separating Lua and C++ code when working with SDL.

This is a port of my old test game, [Ebiten Breakout](https://github.com/eliasdaler/ebiten_breakout).

It's in public domain, so do whatever you want with it.

The process of its short development was documented here: https://github.com/eliasdaler/edw.is/discussions/4

I'll be continuing doing stuff with this new "engine", I'll probably release it's iterative versions some day!
